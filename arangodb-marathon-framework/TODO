Immediately:

 - coordinator label for MinuteMan
 - scaling via UI: watch numberOfServers
 - use MESOS containerizer
 - support mount volumes
 - check with strict mode

Later:

 - load balancing? something on public slaves?
 - create setup with haproxy deployment via Marathon on public_slaves

Challenges:

 - stop agency from scaling?
