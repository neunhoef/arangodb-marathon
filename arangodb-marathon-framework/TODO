Immediately:

 - offer HTTP/REST service in framework
 - offer shutdown method
 - clean up persistent volumes and reservations
 - coordinator label for MinuteMan

Soon:

 - scaling via UI: watch Agency

Later:

 - load balancing? something on public slaves?
 - create setup with haproxy deployment via Marathon on public_slaves

Challenges:

 - stop agency from scaling?
 - secondaries? -> more support from within ArangoDB, planned anyway
